<h1>Hello, there! &#128075</h1>
<p>I am a Web Dev from Brazil, who is currently learning new technologies for a career leap. My current goal is mastering Front-end, so I can take over the world (of Fullstack). Everything is self-taught, and I love experimenting new things.</p>
<p>Someday I may fill this page with all my projects, but until there, I will keep learning and practicing everything.</p>
